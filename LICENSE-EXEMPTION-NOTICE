The original author acknowledges he is quite stubborn, also acknowledging the rationale behind said behavior below.
The original author acknowledges that acknowledging acknowledgements may, at times, be quite verbose and redundant.

Below you are given permission to redistribute these files in other open source works. 

========================================================


This document hereby grants permission to any work distributed under a license approved by either the 
Open Source Initiative or Free Software Foundation to use and redistribute all files, and their contents, 
found in this software distribution, keeping the original terms of this package.

For distributing alongside GPL software:
Let it also be known this package meets the requirements of "System Library", being relied on to provide
standard interfaces and services for software built using Approach services and functionality. 

These files include, without exception, the entire directory marked "core". 
This directory includes, but is not limited to, the files: 

Component.php, Composition.php, Service.php, and potentially other files.

This document herby also extends the same rights and priviledges of distribution regarding any 
work contained in this software package under Open Source Initiative or Free Software Foundation approved
licenses. This refers to but may not be limited to files in the directory marked "base" 
which are provided under an Apache v2.0 license. 


=========================================================

The above is to let you distribute Approach along side GPL software 
and other open licenses which require permission of the copyright holders.

You may distribute approach, base and core, along software with any open license, approved by any of either: 
the Open Source Initiative, the Free Software Foundation, or Approach Corporation.


======================================================

The copyright holder(s) of this project allow entities to release this code in 
commercial works only under specific terms. This section does not specify a license,
however if the net revenue or change in profit margin provided by a derrivative work 
does not exceed $144,000 (USD), per annum, the work is exempt from commercial restriction.

Eligibility requires registration and approval, to avoid confusion. 
Specific eligibility is outside the scope of this document.

Contact tom@approach.im for more information.

This section is for reference purposes only and is not an agreement 
or promisary note by Approach Corporation or the original author of Approach.

You may obtain such an agreement from Approach Corporation easily by
contacting the project maintainer: garet@approach.im 

Approach Corporation notes however, we shall not prosecute, or hold liable for any costs,
any party using Approch, the Software, for commercial gain of less than $144,000 (USD) per annum.
Only one possible exception exists: co-operative efforts aimed to circumvent this limit. Thus, we
strongly encourage you to request an official agreement from the current project maintainer.

Some situations exist in which we will agree to a higher limit. This is specifically to encourage teams to 
produce the required income to pay salaries for the work an livelihood of team members. We hope to 
encourage stable funding for new open-source projects.

======================================================




If you would like to skip the rationale, don't read the rest. Legal part is over. This is just a notice.




It is noted that both the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and the Open Source Initiative (OSI) do not approve
of this license being called "Open Source". Approach Corporation has deep resepct for both movement, both
technically and philosophically. Many of our projects will continually use OSI approved licenses and provide
real support for non-Approach projects in the Open Source community in the form of much needed coding hours
and documentation help.

Certainly the licenses certified at both the  OSI and FSF are indeed open source.

Approach, in no small part, disagrees with the full definition of the "openness" of a source. 
Neither organization has any actuall authority to define openness. Both are a result of gained social momentum.

While agreeing with both organizations that their respective, and partially competing, definitions define
a *subset* of open source, we will differentiate into what Approach Corporation will refer to as open technology.

From our perspective, the free and open software movement is impeding freedom (as in free speech) to a large degree.
Current open source licenses have enforced an inability towards dynamic commercialization.

There is not one licensed considered open source which has a strongly defined sense of comercial entities.
Yet commerce and open source projects drive each other in many domains. Eventually, they will integrate.

May as well get started. Approach Corporation is releasing under a CC license because it is the most easily
comprehended, and we will take a hit on all the smaller instances of "commercial use" that are difficult to 
define.

Actually, this is to KEEP the heart of our code base open, instead of just saying here's the open part, pay for optimizations.
We have a different model, and we're working on a more organic license that's claiming to be open even though there's 
a 'forbidden' (according to FSF and OSI) royalty invovled. 

We know this might be an uphill battle, but we're keeping it free for projects that make under $144,000 USD a year.
Free for research, free for personal use, free for educational and even -infrastructure- if you pay your developers to make it.

We are going to set up *reasonable* terms that are more flexible for marketplace, but stay free (as in free beer) for individual use.
Importantly, unlike other free-as-in-speech open software, you are free to collect a reasonable royalty downstream in our future licensure.

Just one more thing. There's another quick, important reason that the current definition is over-zealous.

Even if the most constrained license in the world lets me view the source code of something awesome, and learn from it, it is somewhat open. 
READ ONLY IS OPEN. The value of sharing code is greater than the value of obtaining functionality.

Especially for posterity. Patents and copyrights expire, eventually, but understanding and transparency are more at the heart of open source. 
Collaboration and cooperation of is better, but its all subjective.

Companies brave enough to show what they have should be encouraged, even if they dont want to let everyone fork it and compete with them.

Bringing in the corps lets us fascillitate faster to market, better and more intuitive standards. 




Anyway, due to all the above, I'm adding the notice that the original author and copyright holder
authorizes you to distribute Approach together with other licenses that are OSI or FSF approved. GPL,
for instance, allows you to write GPL software using Approach and distributing together as long as 
you get permission from the original author. 

So, if you are just including Approach as a package to your Linux distro for instance, and not 
selling some product, service or web service based on Approach, go right ahead, free of charge. 

If you integrate Approach into a BSD, MIT, MPL, GPL, OSL, or most other open licensed software to 
provide additional functionality, but your full source is available online, you may continue to sell
your product on your current model. Only concern yourself if you offer substaintial cost increases
for products or services based around your new additions.

Feel free to contact garet@approach.im for a more official notice or more specific version of your exemption.
