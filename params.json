Due to constant contributions from FlipSide Technologies, or my personal involvement, some developers freely contributed to a past proprietary version of Approach. \r\n\r\nSincere thanks to all developers who have contributed until now. \r\n\r\nMuch of Approach has been dissected and systematically deleted to allow re-implementation of features at intuitive levels delivering a new breed of user, developer, computer and organization friendly workflows all at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompeting paradigms abound in our industry:\r\n\r\n- Proceedural (considered oldie but a goodie)\r\n- Object Oriented\r\n- Dataflow Oriented & Flow Driven\r\n- Service Oriented Architecture\r\n- Event Driven / Asynchronous\r\n- Parallell Programming is in and out of all of these\r\n- Recursion Oriented (I'm lookin' at you, LISPs)\r\n- Component Oriented\r\n- More being made all the time\r\n\r\n\r\nApproach allows you to write applications using any mixture of these methods you like, or none at all. Well, except for procedural - technically all programs are.\r\n\r\nApproach has an architecture that is collapsible, replaceable, reverse-nesting capable, and embedding-capable. \r\n\r\nApproach enables, it does not orient. Organic systems only orient locally, and this is at the heart of Approach.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, Approach is soon coming in many flavors and with an app builder for non-programmers. PHP, Java/Droid, C# AND C++, JavaScript\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask for others, but if they aren't in that list you should just get my help while you write the fork! Don't worry, it's easy!\r\n\r\nYou can follow various forms of shameless self promotion as I start this project at \r\nhttps://twitter.com/ApproachGaret\r\n\r\nSeriously, can't believe I would get a Twitter.. oh boy..\r\nSoon you can also follow opinionated opinions at my blog at the Approach site.\r\n\r\nCheers, -Garet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE COMPOSITION BUILDING WITH PLAIN RENDERABLES\r\n\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n$pub=new Composition($options); //this is an array of options\r\n$pub->init($options); //options are optional.
