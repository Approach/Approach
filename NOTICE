This document hereby grants permission to any work distributed under a license approved by either the 
Open Source Initiative or Free Software Foundation to use and redistribute all files, and their contents, 
found in this software distribution, keeping the original terms of this package.

For distributing alongside GPL software:
Let it also be known this package meets the requirements of "System Library", being relied on to provide
standard interfaces and services for software built using Approach services and functionality. 

These files include, without exception, the entire directory marked "core". 
This directory includes, but is not limited to, the files: 

Component.php, Composition.php, Service.php, and potentially other files.

This document herby also extends the same rights and priviledges of distribution regarding any 
work contained in this software package under Open Source Initiative or Free Software Foundation approved
licenses. This refers to but may not be limited to files in the directory marked "base" such as Render.php 
which is provided under an Apache v2.0 license. 


=========================================================

The above is to let you distribute Approach along side GPL software 
and other open licenses which require permission of the copyright holders.

You may distribute approach, base and core, along software with any open license, approved by any of either: 
the Open Source Initiative, the Free Software Foundation, or Approach Foundation LLC.


======================================================

The copyright holder(s) of this project allow entities to release this code in 
commercial works only under specific terms. This section does not specify a license,
however if the net revenue or change in profit margin provided by a work does not
exceed $450,000 (USD), the work is exempt from commercial restriction.

Eligibility requires registration and approval, to avoid confusion. 
Specific eligibility is outside the scope of this document.

or promisary note by Approach Foundation LLC or the original author of Approach.


======================================================




If you would like to skip the rationale, don't read the rest. Legal part is over. This is just a notice.




It is noted that both the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and the Open Source Initiative (OSI) do not approve
of this license being called "Open Source". Approach Foundation has deep resepct for both movement, both
technically and philosophically. Many of our projects will continually use OSI approved licenses and provide
real support for non-Approach projects in the Open Source community in the form of much needed coding hours
and documentation help.

Certainly the licenses certified at both the  OSI and FSF are indeed open source.

Approach in no small part disagrees with the full definition of the "openness" of a source. 
Neither organization has any actuall authority to define openness. Both are a result of gained momentum.

While agreeing with both organizations that their respective, and partially competing, definitions define
a *subset* of open source, we will differentiate into what Approach Foundation will refer to as open technology.

From our perspective, the free and open software movement is impeding freedom (as in free speech) to a large degree.

Have you ever noticed that open source licenses have enforced an inability towards dynamic commercialization?

There is not one licensed considered open source which has a strongly defined sense of comercial entities.
Yet commerce and open source projects drive each other all the time. One day, we are going to integrate.

May as well get started. Approach Foundation is releasing under a CC license because it is the most easily
comprehended, and we will take a hit on all the smaller instances of "commercial use" that are difficult to 
define.

Actually, this is to KEEP the heart of our code base open, instead of just saying here's the open, pay for optimizations.
We have a different model, and we're working on a more organic license that's claiming to be open even though there's 
a forbidden royalty invovled. 

We know this might be an uphill battle, but we're keeping it free for projects that make under $450,000 USD a year.
Free for research, free for personal use, free for educational and even -infrastructure- if you pay your developers to make it.

We are going to set up *reasonable* terms that are more flexible for marketplace, but stay free for anyone on the planet.


Just one more thing. There's another quick, important reason that the current definition is over-zealous.

Even if the most constrained license in the world lets me view the source code of something awesome and learn, 
that is what matters. That's open. READ ONLY IS OPEN. We didn't used to have that, don't you remember?

Especially for posterity. Patents and copyrights expire but understanding and transparency
are more at the heart of open source. Collaboration and cooperation of course is better but it's all rather subjective!

Companies brave enough to show what they have should be encouraged, even if they dont want to let everyone dissect it.

Let's fascillitate faster, better, more intuitive standards with industry support. 






Anyway, due to all the above, I'm adding the notice that the original author and copyright holder
authorizes you to distribute Approach together with other licenses that are OSI or FSF approved. GPL,
for instance, allows you to write GPL software using Approach and distributing together as long as 
you get permission from the original author, and even though I didn't use it - GPL is pretty awesome sometimes.

I reiterate about the current definition of open: 
'tis but a subset of open!
