Approach-Core
=============

Flow, Compositing, Components, Services, Live CMS plus more for cloud enabled PHP applications.
Soon coming to Java/Droid, C++, C# and others.

Approach is a life-oriented, organic architecture for software.

Approach has been made with the helpful review of many passing developers who had worked with me on partnership projects with over 50 different companies and non-profits. Due to constant contributions from FlipSide Technologies, or my personal involvement, some developers freely contributed to a past proprietary version of Approach. 

Sincere thanks to all developers who have contributed until now. 

Much of Approach has been dissected and systematically deleted to allow re-implementation of features at intuitive levels delivering a new breed of user, developer, computer and organization friendly workflows all at once.


Competing paradigms abound in our industry:

- Proceedural (considered oldie but a goodie)
- Object Oriented
- Dataflow Oriented & Flow Driven
- Service Oriented Architecture
- Event Driven / Asynchronous
- Parallell Programming is in and out of all of these
- Recursion Oriented (I'm lookin' at you, LISPs)
- Component Oriented
- More being made all the time


Approach allows you to write applications using any mixture of these methods you like, or none at all. Well, except for procedural - technically all programs are.

Approach has an architecture that is collapsible, replaceable, reverse-nesting capable, and embedding-capable. 

Approach enables, it does not orient. Organic systems only orient locally, and this is at the heart of Approach.


Finally, Approach is soon coming in many flavors and with an app builder for non-programmers. PHP, Java/Droid, C# AND C++, JavaScript

Feel free to ask for others, but if they aren't in that list you should just get my help while you write the fork! Don't worry, it's easy!

Seriously, can't believe I would get a Twitter.. oh boy..
Soon you can also follow opinionated opinions at my blog at the Approach site.
