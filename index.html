<p>Flow, Compositing, Components, Services, Live CMS plus more for cloud enabled PHP applications.
Soon coming to Java/Droid, C++, C# and others.</p>

<p>Approach is a life-oriented, organic architecture for software.</p>

<p>Approach has been made with the helpful review of many passing developers who had worked with me on partnership projects with over 50 different companies and non-profits. Due to constant contributions from FlipSide Technologies, or my personal involvement, some developers freely contributed to a past proprietary version of Approach. </p>

<p>Sincere thanks to all developers who have contributed until now. </p>

<p>Much of Approach has been dissected and systematically deleted to allow re-implementation of features at intuitive levels delivering a new breed of user, developer, computer and organization friendly workflows all at once.</p>

<p>Competing paradigms abound in our industry:</p>

<ul>
<li>Proceedural (considered oldie but a goodie)</li>
<li>Object Oriented</li>
<li>Dataflow Oriented &amp; Flow Driven</li>
<li>Service Oriented Architecture</li>
<li>Event Driven / Asynchronous</li>
<li>Parallell Programming is in and out of all of these</li>
<li>Recursion Oriented (I'm lookin' at you, LISPs)</li>
<li>Component Oriented</li>
<li>More being made all the time</li>
</ul><p>Approach allows you to write applications using any mixture of these methods you like, or none at all. Well, except for procedural - technically all programs are.</p>

<p>Approach has an architecture that is collapsible, replaceable, reverse-nesting capable, and embedding-capable. </p>

<p>Approach enables, it does not orient. Organic systems only orient locally, and this is at the heart of Approach.</p>

<p>Finally, Approach is soon coming in many flavors and with an app builder for non-programmers. PHP, Java/Droid, C# AND C++, JavaScript</p>

<p>Feel free to ask for others, but if they aren't in that list you should just get my help while you write the fork! Don't worry, it's easy!</p>

<p>You can follow various forms of shameless self promotion as I start this project at 
<a href="https://twitter.com/ApproachGaret">https://twitter.com/ApproachGaret</a></p>

<p>Seriously, can't believe I would get a Twitter.. oh boy..
Soon you can also follow opinionated opinions at my blog at the Approach site.</p>

<p>Cheers, -Garet</p>

EXAMPLE COMPOSITION BUILDING WITH PLAIN RENDERABLES

<?php $pub=new Composition($options); //this is an array of options
$pub->init($options); //options are optional. I think there's some issue you want to read the constructor for though


/*        Document Header Section        */

$head = new renderable('head');      //
$head-&gt;content='
    Approach - An approach to organic, human oriented software
';

/*
 * THANK YOU to jQuery, RaphaelJS plus both the Signika and Quattrocento Sans fonts. 
 * Great work that is helping enable development!
 *
 */



//So I also show that you can add stuff through the pub-&gt;DOM. Instead of DOM it might be called "RenderTree"
//Here I just made a renderable and manually add it to the pub. You could do other things like
//$html-&gt;children[]=$head; or $APPROACH_DOM_ROOT-&gt;children[]=$head;
//Just depends on what you're keeping up with today. =)

$pub-&gt;DOM-&gt;children[] = $head;
//    Head is ready, 


/*        Body Section        */

//Gotta have a body. 
$body = new renderable('body');
$body-&gt;attributes['style']='background-color: #fff;';
$pub-&gt;DOM-&gt;children[]=$body;

//Ok I want a big page thing..
$canvas = new renderable('ul', 'canvas');

//usually you have one of these
$heading = new renderable('li', 'Navigation'); 

//and one of these, I bet you're used to them being divs though. You can if you want.
$page = new renderable('li', 'page');  

//Oh I'm just showing how lazy we can be here, really should have put this in the renderable options O_~!
$canvas-&gt;attributes['style']='background-color: white; position: absolute; left: 50%; margin-left: -540px; width: 1080px; height: 100%; padding-bottom: 22px;';

$theContent = new renderable('ul', 'theContent'); //(left-facing div, 678px wide)
$theSidebar = new renderable('ul', 'theSidebar'); //(right-facing div, (300 + 2x10 padding + 2x1 border) = 322px wide)

//page children can be added to variables you made, notice we haven't been using the $pub-&gt;DOM method?
$page-&gt;children[] = $theContent;
$page-&gt;children[] = $theSidebar;


//footer
$footer = new renderable('li', 'footer');

//PSCH, I dont need no stinkin' structure. Well fine! Have it your way:
$footer-&gt;content = '
    
    ANY HTML IN HERE, ALAS GITHUB'S MARKDOWN 
    IS NOT PLAYING NICE WITH EXAMPLE HTML
';



//canvas children, In Garet CSS, sheer just means no padding, no margin, no border.
//I tend to have containers that way and let inner groups have their way with formating
//I'm no style guru! YOU HAVE BEEN DISCLAIMERED
$canvas-&gt;classes[] = 'sheer';
$canvas-&gt;children[] = $heading;
$canvas-&gt;children[] = $page;
$canvas-&gt;children[] = $footer;

//Oh, did we forget about the body? Oh well no worries we can add stuff to it whenever.
$body-&gt;children[] = $canvas;


//And now you see may layout.php file. I include this at the top of most scripts and then just add stuff to
//$TheContent-&gt;children[]= smart or renderable(), bam you've got components.

$pub-&gt;publish();
//Options to send this to file, echo or just get components loaded.
//More options on the way for parallel and async stuff




//Did you know if you can understand this and get your database set up (with any database lib you want),
//Service classes can automatically find most anything in these Compositions individually or in mass, and you
//Can control how much data is being loaded or not, all sorts of bananas.
